Then, what is mind?
What is the thing that we call consciousness?
The only way to know what mind is, is to look into our own consciousness and observe what is happening there.
In the language of the psychologist, we must introspect. 
Because one can never come to understand the nature of mind and its laws of working by listening to lectures or reading text books alone. 
There is no psychology in the text, but only in your living, flowing stream of thought and mine. 
Indeed, the lecture and the book may tell us what to look for when we introspect, and how to understand what we find. 
But the descriptions about our minds must be confirmed by our own observation and experience.
